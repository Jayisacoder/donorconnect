      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white">The Nonprofit Donor Problem</h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">Nonprofits lose most first-time donors before a second gift. Disconnected data, manual follow-ups, and limited staff time create missed touchpoints that erode trust.</p>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-200">
        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Why it matters</h2>
          <p>Retention drives sustainability. Each lost donor increases acquisition costs and shrinks reliable revenue, forcing nonprofits to spend more time fundraising than serving their mission.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Who is affected</h2>
          <p>Development teams, program leads, and donors themselves. Staff lack timely signals; donors feel unseen; leadership loses predictable cash flow.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Consequences of inaction</h2>
          <p>Lower renewal rates, smaller average gifts, and reduced program impact. Without timely outreach, first gifts never turn into relationships.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white">How DonorConnect differs</h2>
          <p>We pair multi-tenant donor/donation tracking with AI summaries and retention risk signals, helping small teams act quickly without heavy CRMs.</p>

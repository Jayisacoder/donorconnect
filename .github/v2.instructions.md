# DonorConnect v2 — Update Instructions

## Goal of This Update

This update aligns your existing **DonorConnect** application with the **Incentive 5 v2 requirements**.

By the end of this update, your app will:
- Be live and publicly accessible
- Support donor and donation management
- Include responsible AI usage
- Clearly demonstrate learning outcomes for assessment

- At least **one AI-powered feature**
- AI Policy & Safeguards page
- Evidence / Rubric page
